Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 

Today I got an update for  docker, looked at the release notes and noticed the WSL - 2 update.
This would have made my old day job so much easier.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 is a full Linux kernel built by Microsoft, which 
lets Linux distributions run without managing virtual machines. With Docker Desktop 
running on WSL 2, users can leverage Linux workspaces and avoid maintaining both 
Linux and Windows build scripts. In addition, WSL 2 provides improvements to file 
system sharing and boot time.
